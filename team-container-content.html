                June Ho is a junior majoring in Computer Science from Orange County, California. Although he didn't compete in Science Olympiad in high school, he did compete in Chemistry Olympiad (earned top 152 honors on the 2016 USNCO) and enjoyed supervising one of the events at last year's invitational. He is excited to serve as co-director this year! Outside of schoolwork and Science Olympiad, June enjoys painting, photography, and video games.

He is still salty (and probably will always be) about choking Experimental Design at states, but still has plenty of fond memories (and lots of medals) from his years of Science Olympiad with West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. If he's running your event, chances are the test will be rather difficult, so be prepared :) In his free time, he enjoys swimming (which comes with great pregames) and playing piano, but usually ends up wasting all of it on Steam. Last year, Bill was the event supervisor for Astronomy.
